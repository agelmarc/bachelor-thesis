In a first application of our extrapolation framework, we want to extrapolate the ground state energies of the nuclei \n{2}{H}, \n{3}{H} and \n{4}{He}, which were already used in the network training and analyze the extrapolation values in dependency on the maximum $N_\mathrm{max}$ of the input sequences. Instead of the many used interactions in the training, we decide on one interaction which will be used as a benchmark to compare this basic extrapolation framework to our more sophisticated methods which will be introduced in the later chapters. We decide on a semi-local momentum space regulated interaction of chiral order 2 with two body interactions and a cutoff at \SI{450}{\mega\electronvolt}. Since this interaction is different to the interactions used in training, we hope to see if the networks captured the characteristics which are own to the nuclei and reproduce those by extrapolating the results of previously unseen interactions.

To investigate the effects of an SRG evolution of the hamiltonian on the extrapolation results, we will further consider the above interaction in the case of an SRG evolution with a paramer of \srg{0.04} and \srg{0.08}.
