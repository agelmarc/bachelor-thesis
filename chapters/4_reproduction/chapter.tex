In a first application of our extrapolation framework, we want to extrapolate the ground-state energies of the nuclei \n{2}{H}, \n{3}{H} and \n{4}{He}, which were already used in the training of the networks and analyze the extrapolation values in dependency on the maximum $N_\mathrm{max}$ of the input sequences. The networks were trained with NCSM calculations for chiral interactions of various leading orders and cutoffs for two-body interactions \cite{entemmachleidt} as well as two- and three-body interactions \cite{HUTHER2020135651}. Furthermore, the Hamiltonians were SRG evolved for flow parameters between \srg{0.04} and \srg{0.08}.

Instead of the many used interactions in the training, we decide on one interaction for the evaluation which will be used as a benchmark to compare this basic extrapolation framework to our more sophisticated methods which will be introduced in the later chapters. For the evaluation, we use a semi-local momentum space regulated $N^2LO$ interaction with two-body interactions and a cutoff at \SI{450}{\mega\electronvolt} by Maris et. al \cite{smsquelle}. By using a different family of interactions for the evaluation than in the training, we hope to see whether the networks have captured the characteristics of the nuclei and reproduce those by extrapolating the results of previously unseen interactions. To investigate the effects of an SRG evolution of the Hamiltonian on the extrapolation results, we will further consider the above interaction in the case of an SRG evolution with a flow parameter $\alpha$ of \srg{0.04} and \srg{0.08}.
