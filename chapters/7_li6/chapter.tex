In a final application of both the absolute and the difference based extrapolation frameworks, we want to evaluate the nucleus \n{6}{Li} by using the same interaction as in the previous chapters.

This application will be special because \n{6}{Li} is not present in the training set. Furthermore, \n{6}{Li} has a higher mass than all of the nuclei considered before. As a result, we can regard \n{6}{Li} as a nucleus for which NCSM calculations can not be done until a sufficiently high $N_\mathrm{max}$, such that extrapolation of the ground-state energy is needed. The evaluation of the \n{6}{Li} extrapolation can thus be considered as a first test of our extrapolation frameworks in a real use-case scenario.
