In this final chapter, we want to look at a few ideas that are based on our extrapolation framework that could further improve the extrapolation of ground-state energies using neural networks.

In a first idea, we want to look at another training modification which will work by dynamically filtering frequencies.

In a second idea, we demonstrate the effect of preselecting frequencies on the extrapolation.

Last, we want to outlay three different general approaches to the idea of using neural networks as an extrapolation tool for ground-state energies.
