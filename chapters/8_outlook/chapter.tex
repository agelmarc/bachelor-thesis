In this final chapter, we want to look at a few ideas that are based on our extrapolation framework that could further improve the extrapolation of ground-state energies using neural networks.

In a first idea, we want to look at another training modification which will work by dynamically filtering frequencies.

In a second idea, we demonstrate the effect of preselecting frequencies on the extrapolation.
