  abstract  = {Artificial neural networks are popular machine learning techniques that simulate the mechanism of learning in biological organisms. The human nervous system contains cells, which are referred to as neurons. The neurons are connected to one another with the use of axons and dendrites, and the connecting regions between axons and dendrites are referred to as synapses. These connections are illustrated in Figure 1.1(a). The strengths of synaptic connections often change in response to external stimuli. This change is how learning takes place in living organisms.},

  abstract  = {Artificial neural networks (ANN) have emerged with successful applications in nuclear physics as well as in many fields of science in recent years. In this paper, ANN have been employed on experimental nuclear charge radii. Statistical modeling of nuclear charge radii using ANN are seen to be successful. Based on the outputs of ANN we have estimated a new simple mass-dependent nuclear charge radii formula. Also, the charge radii, binding energies and two-neutron separation energies of Sn isotopes have been calculated by implementation of a new estimated formula in Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov calculations. The results of the study show that the new estimated formula is useful for describing nuclear charge radii.}

  abstract = {We present a family of nucleon-nucleon (NN) plus three-nucleon (3N) interactions up to N3LO in the chiral expansion that provides an accurate ab initio description of ground-state energies and charge radii up to the medium-mass regime with quantified theory uncertainties. Starting from the NN interactions proposed by Entem, Machleidt and Nosyk, we construct 3N interactions with consistent chiral order, non-local regulator, and cutoff value and explore the dependence of nuclear observables over a range of mass numbers on the 3N low-energy constants. By fixing these constants using the 3H and 16O ground-state energies, we obtain interactions that robustly reproduce experimental energies and radii for a large range from p-shell nuclei to the nickel isotopic chain and resolve many of the deficiencies of previous interactions. Based on the order-by-order convergence and the cutoff dependence of nuclear observables, we assess the uncertainties due the interaction, which yield a significant contribution to the total theory uncertainty.}
