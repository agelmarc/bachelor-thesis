  abstract  = {Artificial neural networks are popular machine learning techniques that simulate the mechanism of learning in biological organisms. The human nervous system contains cells, which are referred to as neurons. The neurons are connected to one another with the use of axons and dendrites, and the connecting regions between axons and dendrites are referred to as synapses. These connections are illustrated in Figure 1.1(a). The strengths of synaptic connections often change in response to external stimuli. This change is how learning takes place in living organisms.},

  journal   = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
  abstract  = {Artificial neural networks (ANN) have emerged with successful applications in nuclear physics as well as in many fields of science in recent years. In this paper, ANN have been employed on experimental nuclear charge radii. Statistical modeling of nuclear charge radii using ANN are seen to be successful. Based on the outputs of ANN we have estimated a new simple mass-dependent nuclear charge radii formula. Also, the charge radii, binding energies and two-neutron separation energies of Sn isotopes have been calculated by implementation of a new estimated formula in Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov calculations. The results of the study show that the new estimated formula is useful for describing nuclear charge radii.}
