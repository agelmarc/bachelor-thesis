  abstract  = {Artificial neural networks are popular machine learning techniques that simulate the mechanism of learning in biological organisms. The human nervous system contains cells, which are referred to as neurons. The neurons are connected to one another with the use of axons and dendrites, and the connecting regions between axons and dendrites are referred to as synapses. These connections are illustrated in FigureÂ 1.1(a). The strengths of synaptic connections often change in response to external stimuli. This change is how learning takes place in living organisms.},
